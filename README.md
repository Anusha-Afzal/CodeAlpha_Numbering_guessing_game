# CodeAlpha_Numbering_guessing_game 
This project was created as part of the **CodeAlpha Program**, designed to help students and professionals build their programming skills through hands-on projects.A fun and simple number guessing game where the computer generates a random number, and the player has to guess it.

## Features
- Random number generation
- Feedback on guesses: "Too high" or "Too low"
- Infinite attempts until the correct guess

## How to Run 
1. Compile the code (e.g., using `g++` for C++).
2. Run the program and start guessing!

## Technologies Used
- C++

## Future Improvements
- Add difficulty levels
- Limit the number of guesses
